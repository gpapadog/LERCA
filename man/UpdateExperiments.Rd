\usage{
UpdateExperiments(
  dta,
  cov_cols,
  current_cutoffs,
  current_coefs,
  current_vars,
  min_exper_sample = 20,
  prop_distribution = c("Uniform", "Normal"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{dta}{Data frame including the covariates as C1, C2, ..., the exposure
as X and the outcome as Y.}

\item{cov_cols}{The indices of the columns including the covariates.}

\item{current_cutoffs}{Numeric of length K. The current values for the
points in the experiment configuraiton.}

\item{current_coefs}{The current coefficients in an array format, with
dimensions corresponding to the exposure/outcome model, the experiments, and
the coefficient (intercept, slope, covariates).}

\item{current_vars}{Matrix. Rows correspond to exposure/outcome model, and
columns to experiments. Entries are the current variances.}

\item{min_exper_sample}{The minimum number of observations within an
experiment. Defaults to 20.}

\item{prop_distribution}{Character vector. Options include 'Uniform' or
'Normal' representing the type of distribution that will be used to propose
a move of the cutoffs in the separate update. Defaults to uniform.}

\item{normal_percent}{Numeric. Parameter controling the width of a normal
proposal for the experiment configuration. Used only when prop_distribution
is set to Normal. Smaller values represent smaller variance of the truncated
normal proposal distribution. Defaults to 1.}

\item{mu_priorY}{Vector of length equal to the number of covariates + 2 with
entries corresponding to the prior mean of the intercept, slope, coefficient
in the outcome model.}

\item{Sigma_priorY}{The normal prior covariance matrix of the parameters in
mu_priorY.}
}
\value{
List. Entries are the new, current and proposed experiment
configuration, the new coefficients and the indicator of acceptance of the
proposed move.
}
\description{
Updating the experiment configuration separately from the inclusion
indicators.
