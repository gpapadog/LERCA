\title{CER estimates from LERCA fit.}
\usage{
GetER(
  dta,
  cutoffs,
  coefs,
  predict_at = NULL,
  grid_length = 100,
  mean_only = FALSE,
  other_function = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dta}{The dataset including columns X (treatment), Y (outcome), and
potential confounders named as C1, C2, ...}

\item{cutoffs}{A 3-dimensional array with dimensions corresponding to chain,
iteration, and number of points in the experiment configuration.}

\item{coefs}{A 4-dimensional array with dimensions corresponding to chain,
iteration, experiment, and variable. Variables are intercept, exposure,
and the potential confounders.}

\item{predict_at}{A vector of the exposure values we wish to predict ER at.
If left NULL, a grid of length grid_length will be created.}

\item{grid_length}{The number of locations we will predict the ER. Defaults
to 100.}

\item{mean_only}{Logical. Set to FALSE if we want the individual ER
predictions. Set to TRUE if we are only interested in the posterior samples
of the mean ER. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{other_function}{Whether we want to apply a different function to the
predictions. Defaults to NULL. Examples include exp(x), log(x).}
}
\description{
Use this function to acquire the ER estimates from a LERCA fit for a set of
exposure values.
