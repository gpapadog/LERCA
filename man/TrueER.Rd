\title{Calculating the true ER of simulated data set.}
\usage{
TrueER(
  dta,
  true_cutoffs,
  out_coefs,
  predict_at = NULL,
  grid_length = 100,
  XY_function = c("linear", "other"),
  XY_spec = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dta}{Data frame. Includes exposure as 'X', outcome as 'Y' and
covariates as C1, C2, ...}

\item{true_cutoffs}{Numeric vector. The true points of the experiment
configuration.}

\item{out_coefs}{Matrix. Rows correspond to experiments and columns to
coefficients (intercept, slope, covariates) in the outcome model.}

\item{predict_at}{The values of the exposure we want to predict the response
at. If left NULL, specify grid_length.}

\item{grid_length}{The number of exposure points we want to estimate the
mean response at. If predict_at is left NULL, an equally-distanced grid of
values of length grid_length over the observed exposure range will be used.
Defaults to 100.}

\item{XY_function}{The true ER shape. Options are 'linear' and 'other'.
Defaults to 'linear'.}

\item{XY_spec}{Function. If XY_function is set to 'other' specify the true
ER shape in XY_spec. Leave NULL otherwise.}
}
\value{
List of two elements. The first one named 'x' is a vector of the 
exposure values at which we evaluated the true ER. The second one named 'y'
is a matrix of rows equal to the number of exposure values in 'x', and
columns equal to the number of observations, including the expected response
of an observation at a specific exposure value.
}
\description{
Based on a simulated data set and known experiment configuration and outcome
model coefficients calculate the exposure response curve.
